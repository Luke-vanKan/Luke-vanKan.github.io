    <h3 class="title">How my culture has influenced my values and identity:
    </h3>
    <p>I grew up with my four brothers and my mother. The biggest thing that has shaped me in a positive way growing up in my environment was how little my mum judged any of us, whether it
       be hobbies, career path, trouble at school and what not, she was always supportive (after giving us an ear full if we were in trouble of course). There is a freedom with having unconditional 
       love and support, with little judgment which is why I aspire to share that quality that Iâ€™ve had at home with the people in my life.
    </p>
    <h3 class="title">My strengths and limitations in terms of my learning and career development:</h3>
    <p>Strengths would be:</p>
        <li>Curiosity to learn</li>
        <li>Ability to push through in hard times</li>
        <li>Ability to accept constructive criticism for improvement</li>
        <br>
        <p>Curiosity to learn is probably my biggest strength, especially with coding. Being genuinely curious about how things work together makes learning less about achieving a result and more about
           understanding. The ability to push through difficult times while learning in the past gives me more confidence that when I inevitably hit a wall, I know I can make it through.
          Lastly, the ability to accept constructive criticism for improvement is a huge strength when learning. Not taking things too personal and realizing that the other person is only trying to help
          is essential.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Weaknesses would be:</p>
        <li>Easily distracted</li>
        <li>Feering failure</li>
        <li>Inexperienced with peer learning</li>
        <br>
        <p>I think I'm a hard worker but distractions are my kryptonite, whether it be social media, gaming or youtube they all make productive hours disappear.
          I have put systems in place to set out time for distractions which has helped but It is something I'll continually have to work on. Feering failure or feeling inadequate is
          something I've felt before while learning and what's helped is to just work on my self talk, realize how far I've come already and one day too this topic will become easy.
          The last thing would be my inexperience with peer learning. Learning has always been a solo journey for me, so something I want to work on is helping others and also asking for help.
