        The technical on Wikipedia definition of neuroplasticity is as follows:
        Neuroplasticity, also known as neural plasticity, or brain plasticity, is the ability of neural networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganization. It is when 
        the brain is rewired to function in some way that differs from how it previously functioned. These changes range from individual neuron pathways making new connections, to 
        systematic adjustments like cortical remapping. Examples of neuroplasticity include circuit and network changes that result from learning a new ability, environmental 
        influences, practice, and psychological stress. <br><br>

        For a long time people thought after you finish puberty your mental development is done, that your mind is static and that it will remain the same for the rest of your life. 
        That was proved wrong, the brain can and does change throughout our lives. Our brain is a large neural network and think of the pathways in these networks as thoughts, habits 
        and skills. The more we go down a pathway the stronger it becomes. If you have ever changed a bad habit, you have carved a new path way in your brain and experienced 
        neuroplasticity. <br><br>

        This is very exciting, realizing that our minds are not fixed but can evolve will have a huge impact on our lives. If you’ve ever said to yourself “I’m not smart enough for 
        this” or “I’m not a math person”  you are not alone and those habitual thoughts are negative paths and roadblocks in your learning. Understanding the principles of 
        neuroplasticity will show you that those roadblocks are not fixed and you can create new positive pathways, which will decrease the amount of times you give up on something or
         fail to even try.<br>

        I found this video very helpful in understanding neuroplasticity 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELpfYCZa87g&ab_channel=Sentis">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELpfYCZa87g&ab_channel=Sentis</a><br><br>

        To have a growth mindset is to have a mindset that our abilities can grow and a mindset of accepting challenges that come your way instead of avoiding them. One way of 
        adopting this mindset is to implement a thought of “not yet”,  when encountering something that you can’t achieve at the moment you train your brain to think “not yet” 
        instead of a fixed mindset of  “I can’t do this”. Research shows an increase in brain activity in students with a growth mindset when encountering an error opposed to 
        little brain activity in those with a fixed mindset.<br><br>

        Learning to be a web developer is no easy task and I’ll be running into errors multiple times a day every day on this journey so adopting this mindset Is essential to my 
        development. I’ll integrate this mindset by working with trying to be more aware of my self-talk and when I do hear a fixed negative talk, try to immediately say the opposite 
        with things like “I’ll get there” and “not yet”. I have put in some hard yards into learning some programming languages already, so reminding myself of how hard and impossible 
        I thought something was at the beginning and how I achieved it after some time will give me fuel when learning something else I think might be too hard for me in the future.<br><br>

        After researching these topics, I’m now looking at the weaknesses I wrote in my learning plan a little differently. I wrote fearing failure as one of the weaknesses, and with 
        trying to adopt more of a growth mindset I will see issues or bumps in the road as less of failures and more of things I’m working on.
