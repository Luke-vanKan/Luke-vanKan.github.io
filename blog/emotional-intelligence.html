      <h3 class="title">What is emotional intelligence and how does it effect you?</h3>
      <p>
        I have been hearing about IQ and how important it is for success for as long as I can remember but in my 24 years emotional intelligence(EI)  or emotional quotient(EQ) is
         a term Iâ€™ve just recently learnt about, even though it is widely thought of as a better indicator of success in the workplace and to identify leaders. IQ is supposed to 
         measure your reasoning and problem solving abilities. While EI is the skill of reading, controlling and evaluating emotions, and with all skills EI can be developed with 
         intentional training. <br> <br>

        Reading emotions is the first step in developing EI. The better we are at reading another person's emotions and the better we can see 
        where those emotions are coming from, will make us more equipped to react appropriately to what they need whether that be encouragement, 
        just to be heard or on the other side of the spectrum if someone is being nastey towards you with no justified reason you will read that <br> <br>
        and not tear yourself down for it.

        What has a similar effect on how you connect with others and how well your mental health is, is the ability to read one's own emotions. Without any training most people go about 
        their day getting identified with every emotion they feel and not thinking twice about it. Say you have an unwanted feeling of anxiety or anger, to have the skill of reading that will
        then lead to an understanding of  where its coming from which makes a pathway to you realizing how silly it is and how non beneficial it is to the situation which will hopefully 
        loosen the grip that those unwanted emotions have on you. Every interaction you have with another person in life is influenced by how your emotional state is, so having a better 
        grasp of your own emotions will then improve your relationships by being less controlled by emotions and more present. <br> <br>

        The ability to increase your own EI is hugely beneficial to yourself and everyone you come across in life but it is not for free, you have to continually work on 
        your ability to listen, empathize and constantly reflect but this effort you put in will pay you back tenfold.
