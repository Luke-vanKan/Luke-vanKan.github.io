      <h3 class="title">What is a class and what is an id?</h3>
      <p>
        Both ids and classes are tags used to identify HTML elements. An element
        can have both an id and belong to a class, the id is used to identify a
        specific HTML element and has to be unique while a class is used to put
        multiple elements into a group. Elements can belong to multiple classes
        but can only have one id, Similar to me at Dev Academy. I'm a part of a
        small 'class' of people in home group 9 and I'm also a part of a larger
        'class' of people in the P≈çhutukawa Auckland intake but with all these
        people there is only one of me and you could say my id is my name (not
        really because you can share names, and ids have to be unique but you
        get it..).

      <h3 class="title">When to Use Class vs ID in CSS</h3>
      <p>
        If you have multiple elements that you want to have the same look,
        classes make doing that much more convenient by giving the developer one
        ruleset to write in their CSS document, then having to only apply the
        name of that class to the HTML elements you wish to share that look. So
        to give an example, if you want certain buttons on the page to look the
        same, you'd put them in the same class but to position each button on
        the page you'd use each button's id to do so. There are no strict rules
        for when to use a class or id, but the best practice of when to use an
        id is when that element is only going to appear once on the page, such
        as headers, footers, or menus. While a class is used for elements such
        as paragraphs, links, and buttons that appear more than once.
