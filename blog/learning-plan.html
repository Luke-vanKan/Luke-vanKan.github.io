        <h3 class="title">What is your long term goal or career pathway</h3>
        <p>I'm not too sure of what my career pathway exactly looks like but I do have a few ideas. The first would be to get a junior web dev job, whether it be working for an agency 
          that has many clients come and go or to work at a large company. Another would be to continue my learning after dev academy and head in another direction and play with blockchain development or dip my toes in
          machine learning. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
        <p>Strengths would be:</p>
        <li>Curiosity to learn</li>
        <li>Ability to push through in hard times</li>
        <li>Ability to accept constructive criticism for improvement</li>
        <br>
        <p>Curiosity to learn is probably my biggest strength, especially with coding. Being genuinely curious about how things work together makes learning less about achieving a result and more about
           understanding. The ability to push through difficult times while learning in the past gives me more confidence that when I inevitably hit a wall, I know I can make it through.
          Lastly, the ability to accept constructive criticism for improvement is a huge strength when learning. Not taking things too personal and realizing that the other person is only trying to help
          is essential.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Weaknesses would be:</p>
        <li>Easily distracted</li>
        <li>Feering failure</li>
        <li>Inexperienced with peer learning</li>
        <br>
        <p>I think I'm a hard worker but distractions are my kryptonite, whether it be social media, gaming or youtube they all make productive hours disappear.
          I have put systems in place to set out time for distractions which has helped but It is something I'll continually have to work on. Feering failure or feeling inadequate is
          something I've felt before while learning and what's helped is to just work on my self talk, realize how far I've come already and one day too this topic will become easy.
          The last thing would be my inexperience with peer learning. Learning has always been a solo journey for me, so something I want to work on is helping others and also asking for help.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>The non-technical skill I want to develop the most would be just an overall improvement on how I work within a team. That includes confidently speaking in front of the team, getting my ideas heard, the ability to empathize
          with my peers and help them when I can.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h3>
        <p>I'll manage my workload by setting regid work hours and removing all distractions during that time. I'll be consistent with journalling a plan for the day ahead and a reflection form the night before,
          every morning, writing exactly what I need to work on and what I aim to achieve each day.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        <p>The first place to seek help will be google but after a while if I can't overcome the problem step 2 will be to ask my peers if they have had this problem and if they could help when they are free.
          If step 2 doesn't work I will repeat that step but will ask one of the facilitators for a hand instead.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>I expect help but only if I reach out, I understand that there are a lot of people and can't expect to be checked up on all the time. I expect the facilitators as well as the students
          to create a positive learning environment for everyone.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
        <p>I play football on thursday nights and saturdays, so could do longer hours on the rest of the days to make up for it but other than that I have nothing else.</p>
