          <h3 class="title">What is your long term goal or career pathway</h3>
          <p>I'm not too sure of what my career pathway exactly looks like but I do have a few ideas. The first would be to get a junior web dev job, whether it be working for an agency
            that has many clients come and go or to work at a large company. Another would be to continue my learning after dev academy and head in another direction and play with blockchain development or dip my toes in
            machine learning.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
          <p>Strengths would be:</p>
          <li>Curiosity to learn</li>
          <li>Ability to push through in hard times</li>
          <li>Ability to accept constructive criticism for improvement</li>
          <br>
          <p>Curiosity to learn is probably my biggest strength, especially with coding. Being genuinely curious about how things work together makes learning less about achieving a result and more about
             understanding. The ability to push through difficult times while learning in the past gives me more confidence that when I inevitably hit a wall, I know I can make it through.
            Lastly, the ability to accept constructive criticism for improvement is a huge strength when learning. Not taking things too personal and realizing that the other person is only trying to help
            is essential.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Weaknesses would be:</p>
          <li>Easily distracted</li>
          <li>Feering failure</li>
          <li>Inexperienced with peer learning</li>
          <br>
          <p>I think I'm a hard worker but distractions are my kryptonite, whether it be social media, gaming or youtube they all make productive hours disappear.
            I have put systems in place to set out time for distractions which has helped but It is something I'll continually have to work on. Feering failure or feeling inadequate is
            something I've felt before while learning and what's helped is to just work on my self talk, realize how far I've come already and one day too this topic will become easy.
            The last thing would be my inexperience with peer learning. Learning has always been a solo journey for me, so something I want to work on is helping others and also asking for help.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
          <p>The non-technical skill I want to develop the most would be just an overall improvement on how I work within a team. That includes confidently speaking in front of the team, getting my ideas heard, the ability to empathize
            with my peers and help them when I can.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h3>
          <p>I'll manage my workload by setting regid work hours and removing all distractions during that time. I'll be consistent with journalling a plan for the day ahead and a reflection form the night before,
            every morning, writing exactly what I need to work on and what I aim to achieve each day.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
          <p>The first place to seek help will be google but after a while if I can't overcome the problem step 2 will be to ask my peers if they have had this problem and if they could help when they are free.
            If step 2 doesn't work I will repeat that step but will ask one of the facilitators for a hand instead.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
          <p>I expect help but only if I reach out, I understand that there are a lot of people and can't expect to be checked up on all the time. I expect the facilitators as well as the students
            to create a positive learning environment for everyone.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
          <p>I play football on thursday nights and saturdays, so could do longer hours on the rest of the days to make up for it but other than that I have nothing else.</p>

        <div>
          <h3 class="title">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            I'm not 100% set on an exact career path but what looks best for me at the moment could be any programming job that is flexible, I'd
            also like to work on personal projects and just continually develop skills in the trade that fascinate me.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title">Re-evaluating my strengths and weaknesses from sprint 2</h3>
          <p>
            I have definitely developed my good healthy habits since starting this course which I'll take into boot camp and have also gotten a lot
            better at dealing with distractions which was one of my weaknesses. Another weakness I have improved on after the core work is the fear of failure with
            now working on having a growth mindset. I also have found new areas to strengthen that I hadn't thought of before like listening and emotional intelligence.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
          <p>
            The biggest non tech issue for me will definitely be talking in front of groups, I'm not looking forward to that at all. I realize it's
            a skill I need to develop so I'll try to but it won't be easy.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
          <p>
            I'd like to improve my ability to effectively work in a group with communicating ideas clearly, taking in and giving feedback, handling rejection etc
          </p>
          <h3 class="title">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
          <p>
            I expect a healthy positive environment to be set and  I expect to be taught what I need to know to land a fullstack dev job.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
          <p>
            for tech problems I'll seek help from google, then a peer, then help from a teacher and for core I'll discuss problems with the human skills facilitator.
            For me I'm at my best when I'm exercising, every day, with a good sleep and looking after my mental health with journaling and meditation.
            So to manage this intense workload I have to be committed to keeping these things in check.
