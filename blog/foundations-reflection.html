      <h2 class="title">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        I've learnt I can be pretty hard on myself and that's not beneficial and I need to uplift myself and I've learnt that listening and that having empathy for others
        are skills I need to work on.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p>
        Learning to code can be very hard and stressful and the same goes after getting employed in the field. Knowing your values gives an idea of who
        you are and what you stand for so you can stay true to who you are when the stresses of this career path push and pull you. Empathy with yourself and others is essential
        In programming, you need to be kind and understanding to yourself to grow and being understanding of others improves your connections with team members.
        Having a great awareness of your inner self is a great skill to have in improving at any skill and programming is no different, it helps to healthily identify weaknesses
        and how to improve them.

      <h2 class="title">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Was surprised at how much core work we had to do but also surprised at how much of an improvement I felt from it. I especially enjoyed the last two
        sprints with learning about EI and having a growth mindset which will help me with my journey in tech and just life in general.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I found focusing so hard on myself to be a challenge but even more so was sharing that information with people I barely know.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        First off this course is going to be very intense so the core work is giving us the tools to handle that intensity. Secondly
        software is made by teams so the core work helps us to be able to work well in those teams with different personalities.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I don't think so, I feel like working on the core skills will help me handle the stresses of this career and also just improve my life.
